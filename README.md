## What is this?

This project is ``C++ Design Patterns And Derivatives Pricing'' in "modern" C++ for my study.

Since the book was published in 2008, it's been outdated. Hence, I'm going to rewrite it in ''modern'' C++. As of today (13th September 2024), my environment has C++20 compiler. Hence, I'll try to use C++20 features as much as possible.
