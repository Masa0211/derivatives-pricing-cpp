## What is this?

This project is "C++ Design Patterns And Derivatives Pricing" in "modern" C++ for my study.

The first edition of this book was published in 2004 and the second edition was 2008. C++ has changes significantly since then. I read the book about ten years ago. I remember I struggled with understanding the book at that time. Now I realised that it was partially due to some features not required in C++11; memory management for example. Those topics are still educational. However, introductory readers don't have to study those lower-level features in this book. They can refer to other books when being ready. Hence, I'm going to rewrite it in ''modern'' C++ features for my study.
